    <p>
      I am a big fan of declarative code.
      In the past, when I wrote imperative or procedural code,
      I would often not immediately understand what it did just a few days after.
      I found as my code got more declarative, this happened to me less often.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I try to avoid boilerplate code these days.
      The reasons are similar, actually:
      As the noise in the code increases,
      so does the time necessary to understand what is going on.
      Avoid the noise and you have less problems!
    </p>
    <p>
      Libraries such as <a href='http://ramdajs.com'>Ramda</a> are
      a nice way to reach both goals:
      Writing declarative code thanks to functional programming style
      while at the same time avoiding boilerplate code due to point-free programming.
      If you are a frontend developer and don't know it yet,
      you should definitely check it out!
